# Getting and Cleaning Data - Project ReadMe

Contents:
- ReadMe.md 
- CodeBook.md
- project_output_sk.txt
- UCI HAR Dataset (contains files needed for the project)
- run_analysis.R
 
Goal:

The objective of the project is to combine all knowledge learned throughout the Data Science specialization at Coursera and apply it to a directory full of messy data (UCI HAR Dataset). We write a function (run_analysis.R) that takes the messy directory and spits out a tidy dataset (project_output_sk.txt) after cleanining and manipulating the data. Please refer to the Code Book (CodeBook.md) to get an overview of the variables used in the analysis. 

Code can be ran after sourcing with the following code:

source("run_anaylsis.R")

run_analysis()
